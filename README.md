# bash_help
Things I find useful to have in my bash

This repo contains bash script that I use on a day to day basis but in a much tidier way than I've been doing so far. 

# How to use

- clone this repo locally 
- add the following statement to the bash file `source /path/to/your/repo/bash_help/controller.sh`
- refresh bash `source ~/.bashrc`
- you're ready to go
